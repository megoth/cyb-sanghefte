THE PARACHUTE JUMPER.
Here's a song about a jumper and his tragic death.
Here's a song about a jumper and his tragic death.
Here's a song about a jumper and his tragic death.
and he ain't gonna jump no more.

:/: singing glory, glory halleluja :/:
and he aint gonna jump no more.

He jumped from 50000 and forgot his parachute.
He jumped from 50000 and forgot his parachute.
He jumped from 50000 and forgot his parachute.
and he ain't gonna jump no more.

:/: singing glory, glory halleluja :/:
and he aint gonna jump no more.

He was the last to leave the plane and first to hit the ground.

Refr.

He packed up his old underware instead of his parachute.

Refr.

They scrapped him from the ground with a tiny silver spoon.

Refr.

They put him in an envelope and sent him home to ma'.

Refr.
