When the saints go marching in

Oh, I'm just a weary pilgrim, travlin' thru this world of sin,
gettin ready for the day, when the saints go marching in.

Oh, when the saints come marchin'in,
Oh, when the saints come marchin'in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
when the sains come marchin'in.

2. Oh' when the golden trumpet calls,
3. Oh, when we lay our burden by,
4. And the sun will shine no more,
5. When storm clouds cover all the earth,

6. And when we climb the golden stair,
7. And when we gather at the throne
8. And when we crown him Lord of Lords,
9. And when we meet that heavenly host
10. Oh, on that great deliverance day,

11. Oh, when the saints go marchin'in,
