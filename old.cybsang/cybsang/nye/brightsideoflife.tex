Cheer up, Brian.  You know what they say.\\
Some things in life are bad,\\
They can really make you mad.\\
Other things just make you swear and curse.\\
When you're chewing on life's gristle,\\
Don't grumble, give a whistle!\\
And this'll help things turn out for the best...\\
And...\\
\\
{\it (the music fades into the song)} \\

Always look on the bright side of life...\\

If life seems jolly rotten,\\
There's something you've forgotten!\\
And that's to laugh and smile \\
\hspace*{3cm}and dance and sing,\\
\\
When you're feeling in the dumps,\\
Don't be silly chumps,\\
Just purse your lips and whistle \\
\hspace*{3cm}-- that's the thing!\\
And... \\

Come on!\\

Always look on the bright side of life...\\

For life is quite absurd,\\
And death's the final word.\\
You must always face the curtain with a bow!\\
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin,\\
Enjoy it -- it's the last chance anyhow!\\
\\
So always look on the bright side of death!\\
Just before you draw your terminal breath.\\
Life's a piece of shit,\\
When you look at it.\\
\\
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,\\
You'll see it's all a show,\\
Keep 'em laughing as you go.\\
Just remember that the last laugh is on you!\\
