Sit on my face

Sit on my face an tell me that you love me,
I'll sit on your face and do the same to you.
I love to be hear you cralize,
and when l'm between you tights,
you blow me away!

Sit on my face an let your lips embrace me
I'll sit on you face and do the same to you too.
Love can be fine when we're both 69
Sing: rapadapadapa...
till we blow away!
