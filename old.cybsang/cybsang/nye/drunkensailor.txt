What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
early in the morning?

Hooray and up she rises, (3x)
early in the morning.

Put him in the longboat till he's sober (3x)
early in the morning.

Pull out the plug and wet him all over. (3x)
early in the morning.

Put him in the scuppers with a nosepipe on him (3x)
early in the morning.

Heave him by the leg in a running bow-lin (3x)
early in the morning.

Shave his belly with a rusty razor (3x)
early in the morning.

Put him in the bed with the captain's daugther (3x)
early in the morning.

That's what we do with the drunken sailor (3x)
early in the morning.
