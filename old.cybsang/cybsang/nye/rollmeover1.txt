Roll me over

This was number one, and the show just begun.

Chorus:
Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.
I like the felling, roll me over, Yankee soldier.
Roll me over, lay me down and do it again, again...

This was number two, and my hand was on her shoe.
This was number tree, and my hand was on her knee.
This was number four, and her clothes was on the floor.
This was number five, and the girl was still alive.

This was number six, and I used my dirty tricks.
This was number seven, and I thought I was in heaven.
This was number eight, and she cried I cannot wait.
This was number nine, and I took her from behind.

This was number ten, and I used my fountain pen.
This was number eleven, and she says: Again from seven.
Thls was number twenty, and my fountain pen was empty.
This was number 10394, and still she cries for more.
