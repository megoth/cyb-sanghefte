\sang{SIT ON MY FACE}

\vers{
Sit on my face an tell me that you love me, \\
I'll sit on your face and do the same to you. \\
I love to hear you moralize, \\  % stemmer dette ???????
and when l'm between you tights, \\
you blow me away! \\
}
\vers{
Sit on my face an let your lips embrace me \\
I'll sit on you face and do the same to you.\\
Love can be fine when we're both 69 \\
Sing: rapadapadapa... \\
till we blow away! \\
}
