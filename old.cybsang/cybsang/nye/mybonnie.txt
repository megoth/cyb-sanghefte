My Bonnie

My Bonnie is over the ocean,
My Bonnie is over the sea,
My Bonnie is over the ocean,
Oh! Bring back my Bonnie to me.

Chorus:
Bring back, bring back,
Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me,
Bring back, bring back
Oh! Bring back my Bonnie to me.

Oh, Blow, ye winds, over the ocean,
And blow, ye winds, over the sea;
Oh, Blow ye winds, over the ocean,
And bring back my Bonnie to me.

Chorus. ..

Last night as I lay on my pillow,
Last night as I lay on my bed;
Last night as I lay on my pillow
I dream'd that my Bonnie was dead.

Chorus...

The winds have blown over the ocean,
The winds have blown over the sea;
the winds have blown over the ocean,
And brought back my Bonnie to me.

Chorus. ..
