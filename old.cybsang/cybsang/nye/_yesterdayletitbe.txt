Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking word of wisdom, let it be.
An in my hour of darkness she is
standing right in front of me.
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Chorus:
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people living in the world
agree there will be an answer, let it be. For though
they may be parted there is still a chance that they will
see, there will be an answer, let it be.

Chorus....

And when the nght is cloudy, there is still a light that
shines on me, shine until tomorrow, let it be. wake
up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Chorus...




Yesterday

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay:
Oh, I believe in yesterday!

Suddenly l'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I don't know,
she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh I believe in yesterday!
Mmmm..................
Oh I believe in yesterday!


J. Lennon/P. McCartney
